# Tree Traversal

### Breadth First
* Level Order - Level by level (Top to Bottom - Right to Left)
### Depth First
* Pre-order - Root, Left, Right
* In-order - Left, Root, Right (Sorted Values)
* Post-order - Left, Right, Root (Height Of Tree)

# Applications Of Trees
1. Database Indexing
2. Autocompletion in search bar
3. Compiler - Parse Tress
4. Compression Algorithm
5. Blockhain Merkel Tree
6. Git - Version Controlling System 

# Terminologies

### Depth Of Node: 
- No of Edges from root to target node

### Height Of Node:
- Leaf Nodes Height = 0
- Longest path from a leaf to node

### Height Of Tree
- Height of Tree is height of a root Node
